<p>&ldquo;You asked for a brief sketch of my stuff that is connected with my imaginary world. It is difficult to say anything without saying too much: the attempt to say a few words opens a floodgate of excitement, the egoist and artist at once desires to say how the stuff has grown&rdquo; <em>Letter 131 from J.R.R.

<h3 id="discover-the-capital-arcadia">Discover the capital Arcadia</h3>
<p><img src="/./images/arcadia-looks.png" alt="Arcadia landscape!" title="Arcadia landscape"></p>
<p>Centered around its capital, <strong>Arcadia</strong>, a symbol of the perfect balance between modern architecture and respect for nature, the city&rsquo;s appeal lies in its clever mix of efficient transportation, impressive buildings, and protected natural areas. These include the stunning <strong>Park of Lights</strong> and the <strong>Taho River</strong>, which gracefully divides the city from west to east.</p>
<p>Thanks to a streamlined efficiency where the hum of technology is the constant background to every waking moment, life in the capital is a symphony of perfect order. Citizens from all over <strong>Aura</strong> appreciate the safety and thriving economy the government of Arcadia has managed to achieve over the years. With strict law enforcement, a highly skilled workforce, and political collaborations with neighboring megacities, <strong>Arcadia</strong> has become a destination for many. It is, for them, a tangible heaven filled with wealth.</p>
<p>Students dream of joining its prestigious university: <strong>Arcadia Central University</strong>, while start-ups and private companies are drawn by the promise of financial success. Meanwhile, tourists visit the city&rsquo;s art centers, explore its historic buildings, and attend a variety of concerts and festivals.</p>
<h3 id="discover-the-industrial-city-of-midgar">Discover the industrial city of Midgar</h3>
<p><img src="/./images/midgar-landscape.png" alt="Midgar landscape!" title="Midgar landscape"></p>
<p>Located to the east of Arcadia, the city of <strong>Midgar</strong> expands. Developed during the industrial revolution, the city thrived thanks to its industrial district, where companies like <strong>Shinra</strong> earned millions by exploiting and shipping resources. The great factory complex dominates the landscape with its chimneys perpetually spewing thick plumes of smoke. Constructed in a labyrinth of iron and concrete, the residents of <strong>Midgar</strong> live in compact buildings that stretch to the hazy horizon.</p>
<p>Life in the town is a constant, grinding rhythm of work, where the port and train station constantly hum with the arrival and departure of freight. Despite its unwelcoming design and brutalist architecture, it is the most populated city on <strong>Aura</strong>, attracting families and workers from rural areas.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s reputation as a center for logistics is unmatched. Its officials sacrifice all land and natural spaces in their endless pursuit of profit, a fact the residents have accepted and sometimes suffer from, as public institutions like hospitals and police struggle to keep up with the population growth.</p>
<h3 id="discover-its-rural-regions">Discover its rural regions</h3>
<p><img src="/./images/wutai-looks.png" alt="Wutai landscape!" title="Wutai landscape"></p>
<p>Beyond the cities lies the second, far more ancient half of <strong>Aura</strong>. The urban grid gives way to vast, untamed landscapes: desert hills, isolated islands, and craggy mountains that touch the clouds. Here, humanity lives at a different rhythm, one dictated by the seasons and local communities. Villages like <strong>Nibelheim</strong>, <strong>Wutai</strong>, and <strong>Winhill</strong> huddle in the valleys, their homes smaller, their lives a stark contrast to the sterile precision of the cities. They live at a slower pace, away from all the futuristic fanciness of the cities. Their existence presents a challenge to the government of Arcadia, as they are often reluctant to align their policies with the capital.</p>
<p>Keepers of a more traditional approach, they refuse to sacrifice their local identity to become another impersonal area of Aura.</p>
