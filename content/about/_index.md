I am a fiction writer focused on fanfictions and original stories, with recurring interests in thriller, romance, and adventure. My work explores how individuals behave when placed inside systems that challenge their sense of self, when navigating multi-layered political plots, challenging growth and emotional journey.

I write stories as a hobby and I work alone on writing, editing and promoting my work.
