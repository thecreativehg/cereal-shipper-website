title: "Discover the world of Gaia"
type: page

**Gaia** is a world that breathes in light and exhales memory. From orbit, its surface appears veined with luminescence—rivers of cerulean energy threading continents like living arteries—yet connecting islands, deserts and mountains to the central continent.  The planet’s axis tilts not only through space but through eras, and nowhere is this tension more pronounced than in the lands surrounding its capital.

### Arcadia stands at the heart of Gaia, a capital in both the political and metaphysical sense.
![Arcadia landscape!](/images/arcadia-looks.png "Arcadia the capital of the world")

**Arcadia** is a symbol of the perfect balance between modern architecture and respect for nature. The city's appeal lies in its clever mix of efficient transportation, impressive buildings, and protected natural areas. These include the stunning **Park of Lights** and the **Taho River**, which gracefully divides the city from west to east.

Thanks to a streamlined efficiency where the hum of technology is the constant background to every waking moment, life in the capital is a symphony of perfect order. Citizens from all over **Gaia** appreciate the safety and thriving economy the government of Arcadia has managed to achieve over the years. With strict law enforcement, a highly skilled workforce, and political collaborations with neighboring megacities, **Arcadia** has become a destination for many. It is, for them, a tangible heaven filled with wealth.

Students dream of joining its prestigious university: **Arcadia Central University**, while start-ups and private companies are drawn by the promise of financial success. Meanwhile, tourists visit the city's art centers, explore its historic buildings, and attend a variety of concerts and festivals.

### To the east, the horizon darkens under the shadow of Midgar

Where Arcadia curves upward in harmony, **Midgar** sprawls outward in defiance. Developed during the industrial revolution, the city thrived thanks to its industrial district, where companies like **Shinra** earned millions by exploiting and shipping resources. The great factory complex dominates the landscape with its chimneys perpetually spewing thick plumes of smoke. Constructed in a labyrinth of iron and concrete, the residents of **Midgar** live in compact buildings that stretch to the hazy horizon.

Life in the town is a constant, grinding rhythm of work, where the port and train station constantly hum with the arrival and departure of freight. Despite its unwelcoming design and brutalist architecture, it is the most populated city on **Gaia**, attracting families and workers from rural areas.

The city's reputation as a center for logistics is unmatched. Its officials sacrifice all land and natural spaces in their endless pursuit of profit, a fact the residents have accepted and sometimes suffer from, as public institutions like hospitals and police struggle to keep up with the population growth.

### Westward, beyond Arcadia's perimeter, lies Balamb Garden

**Balamb Garden** is a city designed not for survival but for indulgence. Enclosed within a climate-controlled shell of translucent crystal, **Balamb Garden** is a study in curated perfection. Artificial seas lap against marble promenades, and residential towers are shaped to echo ancient floral motifs, their petals unfolding toward the sun. Here live diplomats, strategists, and heirs in magnificent houses. Yet even in luxury, there is unease. The Garden’s shielding systems hum constantly, warding off the subtle fluctuations in **Gaia’s energy field**, and its residents try to ignore life outside their cocoon.


### Beyond the cities lies the second, far more ancient half of Gaia
![Nibelheim landscape!](/images/nibelheim-landscape.png "the village of Nibelheim") 

Two hours from **Arcadia**, the land remembers what it was before megacities appeared. **Nibelheim** rests in a mountain basin where stone cottages cling to slopes veined with glowing mineral seams. The villagers draw heat and light directly from the earth, offering songs and silence in exchange. The mountains above are crowned with perpetual cloud, and sometimes, when the wind shifts, the peaks seem to whisper names long forgotten. 

**Nibelheim** endures through reverence and restraint, a quiet counterpoint to the capital’s hunger. Here, humanity lives at a different rhythm, one dictated by the seasons and local communities. Their existence presents a challenge to the government of Arcadia, as they are often reluctant to align their policies with the capital. Keepers of a more traditional approach, they refuse to sacrifice their local identity to become another impersonal area of **Gaia**.

### On the other side of the mountains

Farther south, where forests thin into terraced hills and the sea carries the scent of storms, lies **Wutai**. Once a nexus of martial tradition and spiritual study, it is now a rural constellation of villages bound by shared memory rather than borders. Windmills fashioned with energy-conductive vanes turn slowly above rice fields, harmonizing with the planet’s pulse. Wutai’s people are adaptable, wary of empires, and fiercely protective of their autonomy. They remember when Gaia’s power was sung to, not extracted.
